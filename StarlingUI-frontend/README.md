# Integration Stage

Ready: image list. user db. drones


Pending: Project DB, Upload File, Deployment


for project db test: npx json-server --watch data/project.json --port 8000


## developing

add more info on drones (deploy)

## pending

save data to local storage (browser) - implement it later

## side note

use http://localhost:8080/design/database to see the entire user db

use http://localhost:8080/design/initialize to init the entire user db. it will provide new id for each user, and the project.json needs to be modified correspondingly
