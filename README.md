<img src="https://github.com/ROWAN-W/SummerProject/blob/main/demo.png" width="50%">

### Main Requirement: 
* (Efficient and massive) Deployment of Docker (drone) based on the account (not for security but for personal convenience)
* Simplify the user interface of the existing system (Kubernetes). No more interaction through terminal 

### Second Requirement: 
* Status of drone (power on/off) and status control

### Main Task:
* Study: *Kubernetes API*
* Build a web (additional layer) on Kubernetes *Simple and clean user interface*. Connect our web to the specific *Kubernetes API*

### Project Status:
* **Mickey** is the only user (First degree in Computer Science). It targets drone-goers without computer science knowledge => They have no idea of what Docker, Kuburnates are. Make it behind the scene entirely

### Side Note:
* Our hands are tied with available Kubernetes API
* Abstraction of Docker achieves hardware independent *no need to concern drone as a special hardware too much
